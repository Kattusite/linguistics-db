consonants.json is a file automatically generated by gen/ipa-json.js based on the contents of gen/ipa-consonants.html

This is primarily useful as a starting point to avoid typing hundreds of json entries manually, and in the future it may become convenient to revise the pipeline for this automatic generation, or abandon it entirely.


vowels.json is currently missing some vowels. (ones that aren't on an axis) It isn't automatically generated from anywhere, and is just updated by hand.

If a phoneme can have any property of that type, say "any".

Still need:
ɪ
ʏ
æ
ɐ
ʊ
