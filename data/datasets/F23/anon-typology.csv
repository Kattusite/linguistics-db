Which of the following morphological types does your language fall into *primarily*?,2. What sorts of morphological word-formation strategies does your language use?,3. Which of these best describes the frequency of different types of AFFIXATION in your language?,4. Which of these best describes the frequency of NON-affixational word-formation strategies in your language?,"5. What sorts of functional morphology does your language have (whether affixal, through a morphological process, or free i.e. as a function word)?",6.
