- one of the possible survey answers contains a semicolon, which is meant to be a csv delimiter.
  Miraculously, it turns out this doesn't break anything.
  Google forms treats it as one extra "checked" checkbox for that question, since the semicolon
  is used as a delimiter between selected options.

  However, since the first half of the option matches just fine without the second half,
  and the second half doesn't spuriously match any other search term, we're A-OK.

  The checkbox option was:
    Polysynthetic (= expresses whole sentence meanings in complex words; most sentences have words with 5+ morphemes)
