consonants.json is a file automatically generated by gen/ipa-json.js based on the contents of gen/ipa-consonants.html

This is primarily useful as a starting point to avoid typing hundreds of json entries manually, and in the future it may become convenient to revise the pipeline for this automatic generation, or abandon it entirely.
